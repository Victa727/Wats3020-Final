	<h3>Coffee is Love!...</h3>

<p>When take a sip of good coffee, it warms you up from the inside out. Like a really tight bear hug from your Mom or your Dad or wrapping up in your favorite blanket.</p>
<p>With that thought in mind we feel that more effort we put into selecting the best beans, perfecting the roasting process and making you the perfect cup, the more you will appreciate the coffee drinking experience.</p>
