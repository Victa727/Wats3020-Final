<strong>COLOMBIAN</strong>

<p>COLOMBIA ANDINO</p>
<p>FLAVOR</p>
<p>Every year, Andino Co-Op members &amp; their Bruselas neighbors contribute fully washed coffees to this exclusive lot, with butterscotch and citrus.</p>

<p>LOCATION</p>
<p>Bruselas-Huila</p>
<p>ELEVATION</p>
<p>1600 to 1900 meters</p>

<p>VARIETY</p>
<p>Bourbon Caturra Typica</p>
<p>PRICE / 12OZ. Regular price</p>
<p>$20.50</p><br>





<p>Colombia isn’t exactly new to this whole coffee thing. The nation’s growers became serious exporters in the 19th century, and even created their own marketing arm and imaginary spokesman, Juan Valdez, back in the 1950s.</p>

<p>That longtime commercial expertise continues today. That’s good news for us, for a couple reasons. First and foremost: Plenty of Colombian coffee pros know and care about the difference between specialty coffee and “good enough” coffee. This lot of Andino draws on that knowledge base to assemble a wonderful batch of the former.</p>

<p>Here’s how it works. Our export partner established a little cupping lab in a Bruselas warehouse. When members of the Andino Association and their neighbors feel like they have an exceptional harvest, they just deliver their crop directly to our export partner. There, everybody tastes the samples, and if they pass muster, ship those samples north to us in San Francisco.</p>

<p>In San Francisco, Sarah Jane roasts the samples in our namesake century-old four barrel sample roaster, one hundred grams (about a sandwich bag) at a time. If our tasting notes match those of the producer and our export partner, then that coffee gets included in this batch of Andino.</p>

<p>It’s nice to know there’s some solid knowledge on the ground at source—a couple centuries’ worth--but we still visit in person a couple times a year, as we try to do with all our producers. After all, it’s these relationships that allow us to source such beautiful coffees in the first place.</p>

<strong>ETHIOPIAN</strong>

<p>ETHIOPIA BIFTU GUDINA</p>
<p>FLAVOR</p>
<p>
These dedicated farmers of Agaro grow heirloom varieties under the leadership of Azid, their very sweet co-op leader.</p>



<p>LOCATION</p>
<p>Agaro</p>
<p>ELEVATION</p>
<p>1975 meters</p>

<p>VARIETY</p>
<p>heirloom</p>
<p>PRICE / 12OZ. Regular price</p>
<p>$20.00</p>

<p>There’s so much to tell you about Biftu Gudina that we could write a book. Except for the part about actually sitting down and writing it. And then spell-checking it. Don’t get us started on spell-checking.</p>

<p>So don’t expect a book on Biftu Gudina. For the whole story, join a Sourcing Seminar at our Bay Area homeroom. Meanwhile, here’s the short version:</p>

<p>The year: 2012. The place: West Ethiopia. The characters: us; some folks from the TechnoServe international non-governmental organization; and the neighbors that became the Biftu Gudina co-op.</p>

<p>The setting: fertile soil, healthy plants, honest and dedicated people. Plans for a wet mill and a good road… but nothing more than plans.</p>

<p>The background: TechnoServe advises these folks on establishing their co-op and building their wet mill. We put in our two cents (figuratively) about our quality standards; and we put in several more cents (literally) by fully funding a Harvest Assistant to help Biftu reach said standards.</p>

<p>Flash forward to 2015: Biftu Gudina constructs a second wet mill further into the forest, attracting a few hundred neighboring small-scale local farmers. (Sub-plot: This simultaneously improves the standard of living for members of the Biftu Gudina co-op and their neighbors.)</p>

<p>2016: We host the Biftu chairperson, Yazid, in Addis for his first formal lab cupping. Yazid takes his knowledge back to share with his Biftu co-op members.</p>

<p>The cliffhanger: How will this year’s coffee taste? (Spoiler alert: It’s lovely.)

<strong>RWANDAN</strong>

<p>RWANDA HUYE MOUNTAIN</p>
<p>FLAVOR</p>

<p>A delightful note of dried apricots, followed by the bright touch of bergamont and the delicate sweetness of persimmon.</p>

<p>LOCATION</p>
<p>Huye Mountain</p>
<p>ELEVATION</p>
<p>2000 meters</p>

<p>VARIETY</p>
<p>heirloom</p>
<p>PRICE / 12OZ. Regular price</p>
<p>$18.00</p>

<p>The area has phenomenally rich soil, full of minerals that lead to interesting, complex coffees.</p>

<p>The production of specialty coffee here has been a huge boon. Proceeds from Huye Mountain have gone to things like like health insurance, school fees for kids and food security in the community.</p>
